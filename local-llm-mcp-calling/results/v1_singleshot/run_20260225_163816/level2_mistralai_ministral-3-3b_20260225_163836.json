This change is driven by the need for lower latency and more efficient communication between clients and servers. Below are the key tradeoffs considered:\n\n1. **Performance:**\n   - WebSockets provide bidirectional, low-latency communication compared to HTTP polling, which involves repeated round-trips.\n   - Reduced overhead from frequent connection checks improves responsiveness.\n\n2. **Scalability:**\n   - Polling can become a bottleneck as the number of clients grows, leading to increased server load.\n   - WebSockets allow for direct client-server communication, making it easier to scale with many concurrent connections.\n\n3. **Resource Usage:**\n   - WebSockets maintain persistent connections, reducing connection establishment overhead.\n   - Polling requires constant network checks, which can consume more bandwidth and CPU resources.\n\n4. **Complexity:**\n   - Implementing WebSocket-based notifications introduces additional complexity in terms of state management and error handling.\n   - However, this complexity is justified by the benefits in real-time performance.\n\n5. **Compatibility:**\n   - While WebSockets are widely supported in modern browsers and mobile clients, there may be edge cases with older systems that require fallback mechanisms.\n\nThe decision was made to prioritize real-time responsiveness over simplicity, ensuring that notifications remain timely and efficient for end-users.",
