Performance: WebSockets provide near-instant updates with minimal bandwidth usage, while polling would require constant requests even when no updates are available.\n2. Scalability: WebSockets maintain a persistent connection, which is more efficient for many concurrent users than frequent polling requests.\n3. Development Complexity: Implementing WebSockets requires more initial setup and server infrastructure, but reduces ongoing client-side complexity compared to managing polling intervals.\n4. Reliability: WebSockets can handle temporary disconnections better than polling, as the connection can be automatically re-established without losing context.",
