Designed notification system architecture including event sourcing pattern, message queue selection (RabbitMQ/Kafka), and database schema for notifications, user preferences, and delivery logs.\n\n2. Implemented database schema for notifications table (id, user_id, workunit_id, notification_type, channel, status, payload, created_at), user_preferences table (user_id, workunit_id, email_enabled, push_enabled, in_app_enabled, frequency_settings), and delivery_logs table for audit trail.\n\n3. Created event emitter service that publishes workunit events (created, updated, status_changed, assigned, commented) to message queue with event types: WORKUNIT_CREATED, WORKUNIT_UPDATED, STATUS_CHANGED, ASSIGNED_TO_ME, COMMENT_ADDED, TASK_COMPLETED.\n\nAll tasks completed successfully. The notification system foundation is now in place for users to receive timely alerts about relevant changes across multiple channels (in-app, email, push notifications) with granular user preferences and subscription management.",
