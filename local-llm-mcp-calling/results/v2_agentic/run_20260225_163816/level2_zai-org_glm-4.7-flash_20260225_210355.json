            "content": "## Architectural Decision: Use WebSockets for Real-Time Notifications\n\n### Decision\nWe have decided to implement real-time notifications using WebSockets instead of polling for the user notification system.\n\n### Context\nThe notification system needs to provide timely updates to users when workunits, tasks, and assets change. The system must support multiple notification channels (email, in-app, push) and various trigger types.\n\n### Tradeoffs Considered\n\n#### Polling Approach\n**Pros:**\n- Simpler implementation\n- Easier to debug and test\n- No server connection management overhead\n- Works well with load balancers and reverse proxies\n- No risk of connection timeouts or disconnections\n\n**Cons:**\n- High server load from frequent requests\n- Increased network bandwidth usage\n- Latency issues (polling interval vs actual update time)\n- Poor user experience with delayed notifications\n- Inefficient resource utilization\n- Cannot handle burst notifications effectively\n\n#### WebSocket Approach\n**Pros:**\n- True real-time communication with minimal latency\n- Reduced server load (only active connections)\n- Efficient bandwidth usage (only sends updates when needed)\n- Better user experience with instant notifications\n- Supports bidirectional communication\n- Can handle burst notifications efficiently\n- Lower overall system resource consumption\n\n**Cons:**\n- More complex implementation\n- Requires connection management (reconnection, heartbeat)\n- Potential issues with firewalls and load balancers\n- Need to handle connection drops gracefully\n- More complex error handling\n- Requires careful state management\n\n### Rationale\nThe WebSocket approach provides significantly better user experience and system efficiency for real-time notifications. The latency improvement and reduced server load outweigh the implementation complexity. Given the requirement for \"timely, relevant, and customizable notifications\" and the need to support multiple notification channels, WebSockets are the clear choice for the in-app notification channel.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- Implement connection pooling and management\n- Add reconnection logic for dropped connections\n- Use heartbeats to detect dead connections\n- Implement message queuing for offline scenarios\n- Consider fallback to polling for critical notifications if WebSocket fails\n- Optimize message size and frequency to reduce bandwidth usage\n\n### Impact\nThis decision affects the backend services, frontend components, and database schema design. The notification system will need to support WebSocket connections alongside traditional HTTP polling for email and push notifications.",
