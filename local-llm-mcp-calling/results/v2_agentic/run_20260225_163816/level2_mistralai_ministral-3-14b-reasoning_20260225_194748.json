            "title": "Architectural Decision: Use WebSockets for Real-Time Notifications",
            "content": "We have decided to use WebSockets instead of polling for our real-time notification feature. This decision was made after considering the following tradeoffs:\n\n1. **Latency and Responsiveness**:\n   - **WebSockets**: Provide low-latency, bidirectional communication between the client and server. This ensures that notifications are delivered instantly, improving user responsiveness.\n   - **Polling**: Introduces artificial delays (e.g., every 5 seconds), which can make the system feel sluggish. Users may not receive updates immediately, leading to a poorer user experience.\n\n2. **Bandwidth and Efficiency**:\n   - **WebSockets**: Maintain an open connection, allowing for efficient data transmission with minimal overhead. This is especially beneficial for high-frequency notifications, as it avoids redundant requests and responses.\n   - **Polling**: Can be inefficient, particularly in scenarios where the server is idle or there are no updates. Each poll request consumes bandwidth, even if no new data is available.\n\n3. **Scalability**:\n   - **WebSockets**: Require careful management of connections to avoid resource exhaustion on the server. However, with proper connection handling and load balancing, WebSockets can scale effectively for real-time applications.\n   - **Polling**: Is inherently more scalable in simple scenarios but can become a bottleneck under high load due to repeated requests.\n\n4. **Complexity**:\n   - **WebSockets**: Introduce complexity in managing connections, handling disconnections, and ensuring reliability (e.g., reconnection logic). However, this complexity is justified by the benefits in performance and user experience.\n   - **Polling**: Is simpler to implement but can lead to a less responsive system if not optimized properly.\n\n5. **Real-Time Features**:\n   - **WebSockets**: Enable real-time features such as live updates, chat, and collaborative editing, which are critical for modern applications like Workunit.\n   - **Polling**: Does not natively support bidirectional communication, making it less suitable for advanced real-time interactions.\n\n6. **Server Load**:\n   - **WebSockets**: Can increase server load if not managed properly, especially during peak usage times. However, this can be mitigated with techniques like connection timeouts and load balancing.\n   - **Polling**: Reduces server load in scenarios where notifications are infrequent but can lead to increased load if overused or misconfigured.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nWebSockets provide a significant advantage in terms of latency, efficiency, and real-time capabilities. While they introduce some complexity, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks for our notification system. This decision aligns with industry best practices for building scalable and responsive real-time applications.",
