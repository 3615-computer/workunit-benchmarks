This decision was made after evaluating several approaches:\n\nTradeoffs considered:\n1. WebSockets provide true real-time delivery with lower latency and reduced server load compared to polling\n2. Polling would require frequent HTTP requests, increasing bandwidth usage and server overhead\n3. WebSockets maintain a persistent connection, which requires more server resources per user but is more efficient for real-time updates\n4. WebSockets may face challenges with firewalls, proxies, and some network infrastructure that may not handle long-lived connections well\n5. Polling would be simpler to implement initially but would scale poorly as user count increases\n\nWe determined that WebSockets are the right choice because:\n- Our notification system requires near real-time delivery (success criteria specifies <1s latency)\n- We expect high volume (10k+ notifications/day), where polling would create excessive HTTP overhead\n- Modern browsers and servers have excellent WebSocket support\n- The persistent connection model aligns with our user engagement patterns\n\nImplementation considerations:\n- Implement connection heartbeat/keep-alive mechanisms\n- Add reconnection logic for dropped connections\n- Consider fallback to Server-Sent Events (SSE) if WebSocket handshake fails\n- Monitor connection counts and implement load balancing strategies",
