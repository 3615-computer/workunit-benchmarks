This decision was made after evaluating the tradeoffs between the two approaches.\n\nThe primary motivation is to reduce server load and improve response times. Polling creates unnecessary overhead with frequent HTTP requests, while WebSockets provide a persistent connection that allows for efficient real-time communication.\n\nKey considerations included:\n- Server resource utilization: WebSockets significantly reduce CPU and memory usage on the server\n- Latency: Real-time delivery vs. polling intervals (typically 30s-2min)\n- Complexity: WebSockets add some complexity to the client-side implementation\n- Browser support: Modern browsers have excellent WebSocket support\n- Error handling: Need to implement proper reconnection logic for dropped connections\n\nThe decision was made to proceed with WebSocket implementation as the benefits of reduced server load and improved user experience outweigh the additional implementation complexity.",
