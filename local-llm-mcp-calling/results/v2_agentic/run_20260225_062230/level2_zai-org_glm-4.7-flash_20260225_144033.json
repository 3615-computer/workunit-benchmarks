            "content": "## Architectural Decision: Use WebSockets for Real-time Notifications\n\n### Decision\nWe have decided to implement real-time notifications using WebSockets instead of polling for the user notification system.\n\n### Context\nThe notification system needs to provide timely updates to users when workunits, tasks, and assets change. The system must support multiple notification channels (email, in-app, push) and various trigger types.\n\n### Tradeoffs Considered\n\n#### WebSockets Approach\n**Advantages:**\n- **Real-time latency**: Sub-second updates when changes occur\n- **Resource efficiency**: Only active connections consume resources\n- **Push-based**: Server can proactively notify users without requests\n- **Bidirectional communication**: Can handle both push notifications and user interactions\n- **Better user experience**: Immediate feedback for critical updates\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- **Implementation complexity**: Requires WebSocket server setup and connection management\n- **State management**: Need to handle connection drops, reconnections, and state synchronization\n- **Scalability challenges**: More complex to scale horizontally with connection state\n- **Browser compatibility**: Need to handle different browser WebSocket support (though widely supported now)\n- **Firewall/NAT issues**: May require special network configurations\n\n#### Polling Approach\n**Advantages:**\n- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and understand\n- **Reliability**: No connection state to manage\n- **Scalability**: Easier to scale horizontally\n- **Firewall-friendly**: Works through most network configurations\n- **Predictable resource usage**: Can be rate-limited easily\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- **High latency**: Updates may take seconds to minutes to appear\n- **Resource waste**: Frequent requests even when no changes occur\n- **Poor user experience**: Users feel disconnected and out of sync\n- **Server load**: High request volume for minimal benefit\n- **Battery drain**: Particularly problematic for mobile devices\n\n### Decision Rationale\nGiven the requirement for \"timely, relevant, and customizable notifications\" and the success criteria for \"real-time for critical updates,\" the WebSocket approach provides the necessary real-time capabilities that polling cannot achieve. The implementation complexity is justified by the significant improvement in user experience and system responsiveness.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- Use WebSocket library with automatic reconnection handling\n- Implement connection health monitoring and fallback mechanisms\n- Design for graceful degradation if WebSocket fails\n- Consider hybrid approach: WebSocket for critical updates, polling for non-critical notifications\n- Implement proper connection pooling and resource cleanup\n\n### Impact\nThis decision affects the technical architecture, requiring:\n- WebSocket server infrastructure\n- Frontend WebSocket client implementation\n- Connection state management\n- Error handling and fallback strategies\n- Testing for connection stability and reconnection scenarios\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Design WebSocket protocol and message format\n2. Implement WebSocket server with connection management\n3. Create frontend WebSocket client with reconnection logic\n4. Integrate with existing notification system\n5. Test connection reliability and performance",
