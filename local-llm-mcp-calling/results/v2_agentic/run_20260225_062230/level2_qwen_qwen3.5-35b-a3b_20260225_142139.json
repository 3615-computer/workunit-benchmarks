Event hooks for workunit changes (create, update, status change, assignment, comments)\n12. User subscription management API endpoints\n13. Push notification integration (web/mobile)\n14. Email service integration\n\n**Testing & Reliability:**\n15. Notification delivery testing and monitoring\n16. Load testing for high-volume scenarios\n17.

The improved latency and efficiency will provide a better user experience, especially for users on mobile devices where battery life matters. We can implement graceful fallback mechanisms for clients without WebSocket support if needed.\n\nThis decision impacts the backend architecture (need WebSocket server infrastructure), frontend implementation (WebSocket client integration), and deployment considerations.",
