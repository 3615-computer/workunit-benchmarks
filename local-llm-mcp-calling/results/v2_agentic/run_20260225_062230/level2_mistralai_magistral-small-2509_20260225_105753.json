Scalability: WebSockets maintain a persistent connection, which is more efficient for many concurrent users than frequent polling requests.\n3. Development Complexity: Implementing WebSockets requires more initial setup and server infrastructure, but reduces ongoing client-side complexity compared to managing polling intervals.\n4.
