This decision was made after evaluating the following tradeoffs:\n\nWebSocket advantages:\n- Lower latency: Near real-time delivery (typically <100ms) vs polling delays (configurable but typically seconds to minutes)\n- Reduced server load: Single persistent connection per user vs repeated HTTP requests\n- Better bandwidth efficiency: No repeated headers and minimal overhead per message\n- Improved user experience with instant updates\n\nWebSocket challenges:\n- Connection management complexity (reconnection logic, state synchronization)\n- Resource usage on the server (maintaining open connections)\n- Scaling considerations (requires connection-aware load balancing)\n- Firewall/proxy compatibility issues in some enterprise environments\n\nPolling alternatives considered but rejected:\n- Short polling: Higher latency and more HTTP overhead\n- Long polling: Better than short polling but still less efficient than WebSockets\n- Server-Sent Events (SSE): One-way communication only (server to client), insufficient for our bidirectional needs\n\nImplementation approach:\n1. Establish WebSocket connection on client login/session start\n2. Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff\n3. Use Redis pub/sub for scaling across multiple server instances\n4. Add heartbeat mechanism to detect stale connections\n5. Fallback to short polling if WebSocket connection fails after retries\n\nThis decision aligns with our success criteria of <5 second latency for critical events and provides a foundation for future interactive features.",
