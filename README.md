Benchmarks for local and cloud LLM performance on real MCP tool calling.

## Benchmarks

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [local-llm-mcp-calling](local-llm-mcp-calling/) | 21 local LLMs benchmarked on real MCP tool calling — single-shot vs. agentic loop, 28 tasks across 3 difficulty levels |

## About

The published results were generated against a local Workunit dev stack. The runners default to [workunit.app](https://workunit.app) so you can reproduce them against the production MCP server with a free account.
Each benchmark directory contains the runner scripts, task definitions, raw results, and reports.
